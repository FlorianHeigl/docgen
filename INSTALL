- Solaris 10 (x86 and SPARC)

Pre-requisites
--------------
* DocGen requires the following software to be installed:

- Python 2.4 or higher. 2.5 is preferred.
- libxml2
- docbook-xml

Installing DocGen
-----------------

DocGen is currently somewhat manual to install.

Copy all the files into a directory: /usr/local/docgen

You will then need to set up XML catalogs, by adding the following to
your /etc/xml/catalog file, or equivalent:

<!-- New generic paths -->
<delegateURI uriStartString="http://docgen.eigenmagic.com/" catalog="file:///usr/local/docgen/docbook/docgen-catalog.xml"/>
<delegateSystem systemIdStartString="http://docgen.eigenmagic.com/" catalog="file:///usr/local/docgen/docbook/docgen-catalog.xml"/>
