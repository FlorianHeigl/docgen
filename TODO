* Update DTD to reflect new schema, so that xmllint can work.
* Do something about ENTITY usage within the 'background' element, since
  xmllint will fail this, because it won't have loaded the appropriate stylesheets
  prior to validation.
* Create a deployment Makefile or equivalent to set up the catalogs, etc. or at
  least document what is required to set them up.
* Parameterise organisational specific configuration instead of having to update the
  codebase with the company name, specific legalese, etc. docgen.conf?
* Add the ability to parameterise the .xsl templates for things like the corp_logo
  on the left and right, instead of having to build a custom .xsl yourself. A
  config file will be easier for end users to update.
* Make the colour scheme configurable. Maybe something sortof CSS based?
* Maybe add font selection to docgen.conf?
