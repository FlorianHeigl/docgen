DocGen is software to automatically generate DocBook format XML documents from
high level descriptions of IPSAN project implementations based on the OmniPresenceII
model originally developed at Telstra circa 2005.

DocGen was created by Justin Warren <daedalus@eigenmagic.com> in his spare time 2006 to
assist in the automated creation of complex, yet repetative, documents for the Enterprise
Backup and Recovery (EBR) project, which used the same IP network as the OmniPresence storage
infrastructure. I found manually cutting and pasting into Word documents mindlessly tedious,
and by abstracting the process with DocGen I could create in a couple of hours what used to
take anything from a full day to an entire week.

The original software was written in XSLT 1.0 to assist with portability. This proved complex,
due to the lack of certain features (like loops!) in XSLT 1.0. DocGen was then completely
rewritten in Python around June of 2007 which substantially increased its flexibility, ease
of maintenance, and the ability to quickly add new features.
